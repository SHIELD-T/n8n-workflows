## 📝 DAILY TASK

### **🎯 Main Task: Export All Workflows and Create Backup System**

**Set up comprehensive version control and backup system.**

#### **Version Control Implementation:**

**1. Export All Workflows**
```bash
# Create backup directory
mkdir -p ~/n8n-backups/$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Export workflows (manual process in n8n UI)
# Go to each workflow and export as JSON
# Save to backup directory with descriptive names
```

**2. Create Backup Script**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# n8n-backup.sh

BACKUP_DIR="~/n8n-backups/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Export workflows
echo "Exporting workflows..."
# Add your export commands here

# Copy n8n data directory
echo "Backing up n8n data..."
cp -r ~/.n8n "$BACKUP_DIR/"

# Create backup manifest
echo "Creating backup manifest..."
cat > "$BACKUP_DIR/backup-manifest.txt" << EOF
Backup Date: $(date)
n8n Version: $(n8n --version)
Workflow Count: $(find ~/.n8n/workflows -name "*.json" | wc -l)
Backup Type: Full
EOF

echo "Backup completed: $BACKUP_DIR"
```

**3. Workflow Organization Structure**
```
n8n-workflows/
├── 01-foundation/
│   ├── basic-workflows/
│   ├── trigger-examples/
│   └── error-handling/
├── 02-integrations/
│   ├── api-workflows/
│   ├── webhook-examples/
│   └── data-processing/
├── 03-advanced/
│   ├── complex-workflows/
│   ├── ai-integrations/
│   └── production-ready/
├── 04-templates/
│   ├── reusable-templates/
│   ├── client-workflows/
│   └── business-automation/
└── 05-backups/
    ├── daily-backups/
    ├── weekly-backups/
    └── monthly-backups/
```

**4. Workflow Naming Convention**
```
[Category]-[Function]-[Version]-[Date].json

Examples:
- foundation-webhook-basic-v1-20241201.json
- integration-api-processing-v2-20241201.json
- advanced-ai-workflow-v1-20241201.json
- template-lead-capture-v1-20241201.json
```

**5. Backup Schedule**
```bash
# Daily backup (automated)
0 2 * * * /path/to/n8n-backup.sh

# Weekly full backup
0 3 * * 0 /path/to/n8n-full-backup.sh

# Monthly archive
0 4 1 * * /path/to/n8n-archive.sh
```

#### **Expected Result:**
- All workflows exported and backed up
- Organized folder structure
- Automated backup system
- Version control implemented
- Documentation created
